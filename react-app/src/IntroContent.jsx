      A patent waiver, also called a ‘TRIPS waiver’, would temporarily suspend
      the laws which block factories from making more vaccines.{" "}
      <strong>
        This would allow factories all around the world, especially in
        developing countries, to produce and distribute Covid-19 vaccines.
      </strong>{" "}
      <br /> <br />
      Those laws are there to protect the intellectual property and profit of
      private companies, but a system was set up to allow for waivers in special
      circumstances.{" "}
      <strong>
        We believe that Covid-19 counts as special circumstances.
      </strong>{" "}
      Over 100 countries have supported the waiver, but some, including the UK,
      have denied it.{" "}
      <strong>
        We need the UK government to support the waiver, to ensure that everyone
        across the globe can get the Covid-19 vaccine.{" "}
